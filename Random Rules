The Reserve Rule:
Entering Reserves: Before the game begins, you can choose to place any of your units into Reserves. These units do not start on the battlefield.
Arriving from Reserves: At the end of your Movement Phase on turn two or later, you can bring your units in from Reserves. They must be placed on any battlefield edge that is not your opponent's deployment zone. The unit must be placed more than 9 cm away from any enemy model.
