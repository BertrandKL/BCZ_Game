🏛 The Lost Sovereigns 失落的至尊者
Long before the Eternal Trinity, there was a civilization that ruled the stars — the Sovereigns of Aeons 永劫至尊者.
在永恒三位一体之前，曾有一个统治群星的文明——永劫至尊者。

They alone pierced the fabric of reality and uncovered the Ultimate Gate 终极之门, where dwells the formless god, Yog-Sothoth 尤格·索托斯.
他们独自刺破现实的织布，发现了终极之门，门后居住着无形之神——尤格·索托斯。

To reach Him, they forged the Silver Key 银之钥 — a cosmic artifact that could open all doors of space and time.
为了接近祂，他们铸造了银之钥——一件能开启时空之门的宇宙圣器。

But in their arrogance, they learned too late: Yog-Sothoth was not salvation, but devourer.
然而在他们的傲慢中，他们过于迟才明白：尤格·索托斯并非救赎，而是吞噬。

💀 The Shattering of the Key 钥匙的破碎
Horrified, the Sovereigns shattered the Silver Key into three shards and scattered them across distant stars, hoping no empire would ever reassemble it.
至尊者惊恐万分，将银之钥打碎成三块碎片，散布在遥远的群星之间，祈愿不再有人将其重组。

Their last words were bound into a black tome — the Necronomium 死灵之典, sealed in the ruins of their capital.
他们的最后遗言被封印在一本黑暗经书中——死灵之典，并埋葬在他们的都城废墟里。

The book warned:
书中写道：
“The Gate is the Key. The Key is the End. Seek not Yog-Sothoth, for He is the unravelling of all.”
“门即钥匙，钥匙即终结。勿寻尤格·索托斯，因祂是万物的解体。”

🌌 The Discovery of Ruins 三族发现废墟
A million years later, three young civilizations rose from starlight — Sunborn, Voidhollow, Paradoxians.
百万年后，三大新生文明从群星中崛起——日耀族、虚渊族、悖论族。

Each, through war and exploration, stumbled upon fragments of the ruined Sovereign capital.
他们在战争与探索中，各自闯入至尊者的废墟。

There, they found a shard of the Silver Key and one part of the Necronomium.
在那里，他们各自发现了一块银之钥的碎片，以及死灵之典的一部分。

Each portion of the Necronomium told the same story — yet each was incomplete.
每一部分死灵之典都讲述同一个故事——却都残缺不全。

Thus, every empire believed only they could interpret the truth, if they could gather all pieces together.
因此，每个文明都相信只有他们能解读完整的真理——前提是他们能收集到所有的碎片。

🔥 The Eternal Struggle 永恒的争夺
🌅 The Sunborn 日耀族 — Flame of Erythra 以瑞斯拉之焰
On the desert world of Erythra 以瑞斯拉, beneath a buried citadel of glass, the Sunborn uncovered their treasures.
The Shard of the Silver Key glowed with searing brilliance, blinding those who gazed upon it.
Their Fragment of the Necronomium was inscribed on scorched parchment fused with molten crystal, whispering of “The Flame that Burns Beyond Dawn.”
They named their relic the Ember of Dawn 黎明余烬, claiming it was proof they were chosen to ascend as the rightful heirs of creation. To the Sunborn, their fragment of the Necronomium became a holy scripture, declaring that through fire and light they alone would lead existence into eternity.

🌑 The Voidhollow 虚冥族 — Tomb of N’kai 恩凯之墓
On the lifeless world of N’kai 恩凯, where the air itself devoured breath, the Voidhollow descended into cyclopean tombs of endless night.
Their Shard of the Silver Key whispered in silence, draining warmth from their veins.
Their Fragment of the Necronomium was etched into stone slabs of black basalt, the text shifting like shadows, speaking of “The Fang that Devours Memory.”
They named their relic the Fang of Oblivion 遗忘之牙, a promise that all light and life must return to nothing. To the Voidhollow, their fragment of the Necronomium was not a warning but a promise — that the universe itself must be swallowed by the dark, and they would be its heralds.

🌀 The Paradoxians 悖理族 — Citadel of Yith 伊斯之堡
On the spiraling world of Yith 伊斯, where time coiled and reality folded upon itself, the Paradoxians breached a citadel that existed yesterday, tomorrow, and never.
Their Shard of the Silver Key bent time around it, unmaking causality.
Their Fragment of the Necronomium was carved into mirrored obsidian tablets, the words rearranging themselves whenever read, speaking of “The Knot that Binds Eternity.”
They named their relic the Knot of Eternity 永恒之结, claiming it had not been found but had always belonged to them. To the Paradoxians, their fragment of the Necronomium was proof that reality itself was theirs to rewrite, and that they were both the seekers of godhood and its inevitable rulers.

🕳 The Eternal Trinity 永恒三位一体
Thus the three civilizations — each with a shard of the Silver Key, each with a torn piece of the Necronomium — became locked in endless conflict.
于是，这三大文明——各握有一块银之钥的碎片，各持有一本死灵之典的残卷——陷入了无尽的争斗。

All seek to reforge the Key, open the Gate, and ascend as rulers of the universe.
所有人都渴望重铸钥匙，开启大门，登临宇宙的统治者之位。

But none realize that beyond the Gate waits only the laughter of Yog-Sothoth.
然而无人知晓，大门之后只等待着尤格·索托斯的狂笑。
