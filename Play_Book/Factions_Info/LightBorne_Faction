Faction Lore
The Lightborne are the first children of the Eternal Core, a sentient star from which all radiant life springs. They are a civilization defined by discipline, artistry, and an unyielding devotion to their purpose: to stand as the unblinking sun against the encroaching darkness of the Void. Their forms are living sculptures of light and metal, each movement a graceful, purposeful dance. They see war not as a brutish clash, but as a final, beautiful act of defiance. Every soldier, from the humblest Solar Sentinel to the colossal Attack Moon, is a fragment of the sun's power, a piece of the cosmos fighting to preserve its existence. They do not seek conquest, but to burn away the shadow until only the light remains. Their technology is not built, but grown from the Core's stellar energy, and their psychic powers are not summoned, but sung into existence through a collective harmony of souls.

Warlord's Lore
The Starchild's Lore

The Starchild was chosen by the stars themself, her heart bound to the Eternal Core. With its radiance she bore the gifts of her people — shields of dawn, wings of light, and the forbidden art to stir the hearts of suns. To the Sun Civilization she was both guardian and flame eternal.

The chronicles tell of her greatest trial: the Archmage, once her ally, who sought wisdom beyond light and returned cloaked in Void. His betrayal scarred her people and became the wound remembered in song — the flame and the shadow locked in war across the galaxy. Yet old records note movements too familiar in the enemy’s ranks, a thin blade that slips through the chaos with uncanny precision before vanishing into smoke. Some accounts, dismissed as whispers, even suggest a desperate choice—a pact with the Abyss made not for power, but to protect a fragile hope from a fate worse than silence.

The Dawnbreaker's Lore

The Dawnbreaker’s path was not born of divine decree but forged in the harsh light of discipline. From the moment she could stand, her body was a canvas for the martial arts, each movement a prayer to the sun. Her peers fell away, unable to match her relentless pursuit of perfection, a mastery so profound that every fiber of her being obeyed her conscious will, and her form became a perfect instrument for her purpose. Her own story began in the Silence Shallows, where the Void’s tendrils first began to creep. It was there she first fought the faceless assassin. His movements were a dark mirror of her own, a testament to a harmony she had never seen outside of her own civilization. After the battle, The Starchild met her gaze across the ruined landscape, and in that silent moment, a shared, unspoken truth passed between them—a fragile hypothesis that this shadow was not a weapon of the Void, but a warrior who had simply chosen a different path. The Dawnbreaker now carries the weight of a warrior who found her equal in a place of darkness. She is the embodiment of the martial arts, a master of a discipline that can stand against the Abyss. She understands that the shadows she fights are not empty but shaped by a purpose, and that the path of the assassin is a distorted reflection of her own—a warrior who forsook the light not out of weakness, but because he must.

Attack Moon's Lore

It is a legend whispered only in the deepest archives of the Sun Civilization, a relic of the Old War—the time before the Abyss. The Attack Moon is not a person, but a living construct, a sentient fragment of a star bound in ancient, impenetrable armor. It was built as a last resort, a weapon of such power that it could only be used when all other hope had been lost.

Yet, this weapon was not a creation of the Lightborne alone. In the eons before the Abyss, the Lightborne made a desperate alliance with a race of enigmatic beings from outside of time and space, known only as the Paradox Faction. These architects of reality were masters of forging impossible, self-aware constructs, and the Attack Moon was their greatest contribution.

When The Starchild brought her people's fight to a world consumed by the Void, she did not fight alone. Deep beneath the surface of the planet, hidden and dormant, she awoke the Attack Moon from its slumber. Its immense power is a last-ditch effort, a divine punishment from the Lightborne for the Void's endless malice—but a punishment brought to life by an even more alien and dangerous hand. Its quiet consciousness holds not a vision of the future, but the strange and inscrutable purpose of its co-creators
