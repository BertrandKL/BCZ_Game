## Faction Lore

Forged in the Abyss—not a place, but a living, malevolent consciousness—the Void is a force of silence and corrupted light. Its armies are not trained, but bound, their very existence an extension of its will. The Abyss whispers to its chosen, twisting their bodies and minds until they become perfect vessels for its purpose. These silent legions are a psychological weapon, their very presence a source of dread that can shatter the enemy's will long before their blades clash.

The faction’s signature power, **Abyssal Convergence**, is a manifestation of the Abyss itself, allowing its forces to manipulate reality, teleporting units through the fabric of space to strike with an inevitability that leaves no room for escape.

## Warlord's Lore

### **Void Archmage**
The Archmage was once a scholar of unmatched brilliance, driven to master the deepest roots of magic. His search led him to the Veil Between, where fragments of the Void bled into the world. Unlike others who touched its power and were instantly consumed, he endured. He bent its shadows, wielded its hollow fire, and learned the language of the Abyss itself.

But each victory chained him tighter. The Void did not devour him — it chose him. His body became its vessel, his staff the channel for storms of black flame, his voice the echo of endless darkness. When the mage councils tried to destroy him, he annihilated them with a single incantation, leaving only silence and ash.

From that day, all who faced him understood: he was no longer a man. He was the Void Archmage, the supreme conduit of the Abyss, the strongest mage ever chosen by the Void.

### **The Null Hour**
Forged in silence where the Void devours all light, the Null Hour rose as its chosen vessel. His gift was not mere sorcery, but foresight beyond mortal grasp — to behold kingdoms before their birth, wars before their spark, and the ruin of empires long before the first stone fell.

To others, time is a flowing river. To the Null Hour, it is already shattered, a thousand futures scattered like broken glass. On the battlefield, he moves with dreadful certainty, each strike falling where he has already seen it land, each defense raised before his foes even act. Armies break against him not by strength alone, but by the unbearable weight of inevitability.

Neither savior nor destroyer, he is the Keeper from the Void, cursed to witness the world’s fate before it arrives — and to stand watch at the fragile edge between what must be and what may be.

### **The Gaymaster**
He was once a normal boy who dreamed of mastering the dark blade While others grew strong, he faltered — too slow, too different. His clan mocked him, his master cast him aside, and even those he called brothers spat the word "autism".
But in the silence of exile, he heard whispers from the rainbow realm. It promised strength no master could teach. Desperate, he performed the forbidden rainbow rite. His blood was boiled away, his heart replaced with a core of rainbow flame and obtained The Forsaken Branch.
When he returned, he was no longer the boy they abandoned. Cloaked in prismsteel, he cut down everything in his way. Now, he walks the world as a warlord born of scorn — his enemies feel not just his branch, but the crushing weight of all the years he was denied.

### **Nightblade**
Nightblade is the assassin whispered of in hushed tones — a figure who moves like a fracture in reality itself. His strikes are flawless, his silence suffocating, his blade never seen until it is too late. To witness him is to witness inevitability.

Yet his kills are not chaos. They fall in patterns, as though guided by something beyond command — a symmetry invisible to most, but undeniable to those who study long enough. Historians argue whether this is strategy or madness but soldiers who survive his shadow say otherwise: that he spares some, strikes others with unnatural precision, as though bound to a fond memory, clinging to it as both weapon and curse.
The Void claims him as its perfect weapon. And yet, in the silence after his work is done, there lingers something more - an echo not of darkness, but something the abyss could never forge.
